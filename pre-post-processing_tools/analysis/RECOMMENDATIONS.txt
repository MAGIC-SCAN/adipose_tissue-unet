PREPROCESSING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADIPOSE TISSUE U-NET
================================================================================

Dataset Statistics:
  - Global mean: 200.99
  - Global std: 25.26
  - Stain CV: 12.53%

1. [MEDIUM] Stain Normalization
   Issue: Moderate staining variability (CV: 12.53%)
   Recommendation: Consider per-image adaptive normalization or CLAHE

2. [HIGH] Normalization
   Issue: Current z-score normalization may not handle intensity variations optimally
   Recommendation: Test CLAHE + percentile normalization for better contrast and robustness

3. [MEDIUM] Augmentation
   Issue: Dataset size: 673 training tiles
   Recommendation: Current moderate augmentation is appropriate. Consider heavy augmentation if overfitting occurs

4. [LOW] Class Balance
   Issue: 40% negative tiles - good balance
   Recommendation: Current negative sampling ratio is good. Monitor for class imbalance during training

IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTIONS
================================================================================

1. Immediate Improvements (Easy to implement):
   - Test CLAHE preprocessing before normalization
   - Try percentile normalization instead of z-score
   - Add test-time augmentation for inference

2. Medium-term Improvements:
   - Implement stain normalization if CV > 15%
   - Add morphological post-processing to predictions
   - Experiment with different loss function weights

3. Advanced Techniques:
   - Multi-scale input pyramids
   - Attention mechanisms for boundary refinement
   - Ensemble predictions from multiple checkpoints
